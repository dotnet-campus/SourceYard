Add a NuGet package only for dll reference? By using dotnetCampus.SourceYard, you can pack a NuGet package with source code. By installing the new source code package, all source codes behaviors just like it is in your project.

## Getting Started

### Packing a source NuGet package

Using NuGet tool to install [dotnetCampus.SourceYard](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotnetCampus.SourceYard) to your project

```
PM> Install-Package dotnetCampus.SourceYard 
```

Or

```
dotnet add package dotnetCampus.SourceYard
```

And then you should build your project and you will find the `*.Source.version.nupkg` file in your package output folder

**Remark**

The package with 0.1.19035-alpha version will break the double package reference project.

If you want to support the double package reference project, you can use the package with 0.1.19033-alpha version.
